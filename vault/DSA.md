# Big O Time Complexity
- [ ] O(1) — Constant Time: Given an input of size n, it only takes a single step for the algorithm to accomplish the task.
- [ ] O(log n) — Logarithmic time: given an input of size n, the number of steps it takes to accomplish the task are decreased by some factor with each step.
- [ ] O(n) — Linear Time: Given an input of size n, the number of of steps required is directly related (1 to 1)
- [ ] O(n²) — Quadratic Time: Given an input of size n, the number of steps it takes to accomplish a task is square of n.
- [ ] O(C^n) — Exponential Time: Given an input of size n, the number of steps it takes to accomplish a task is a constant to the n power (pretty large number).
